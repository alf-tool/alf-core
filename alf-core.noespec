    Relational Algebra at your fingertips
  description: |-
    Alf brings the relational algebra both in Shell and in Ruby. In Shell, because
    manipulating any relation-like data source should be as straightforward as a
    one-liner. In Ruby, because I've never understood why programming languages
    provide data structures like arrays, hashes, sets, trees and graphs but not
    _relations_... Let's stop the segregation ;-)
